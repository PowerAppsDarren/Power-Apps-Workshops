Off the top of mu skull...
What is the time frame for the app to be completed?

How are the S.Notification number generated?
By the system? From a pre-determined lot of codes?

Who assigns Tasks?

Is there a time of day that a Task can be started so as to give the Engineer, Reviewer time to complete the Task? Are Tasks expected to be completed the same day?

Can a Engineer be assigned more than one Task at a time? Is there a limit per team member?

When / if an Engineer or Reviewer decides to write comments or change the Task, does the clock start again?
