Could you explain the acronyms and abbreviations used so that I can better understand your needs?

Do you want to make edits or future changes to the application (i.e., changing employees, adding types of work) or will there be ongoing needs from me to maintain it?

Do you already have an M365 tenant, or does one need to be created?

What is needed for capturing meeting occurrence, attendance, meeting notes, or just time spent in the meetings?

Does meeting time count toward actual task time? Are these project meetings that count toward the tasks, or daily briefing/safety meetings that do not?

Could you share some user stories? How/who will be using the application(s), devices that they might be using to interact with them?

Does the application need offline capabilities?

Do you have a specific target date for deployment?

How much time are your employees spending doing this repetitive work?

How much time do you see this app saving?
