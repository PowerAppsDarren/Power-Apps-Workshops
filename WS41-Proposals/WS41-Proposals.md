# Proposals that Turn into Thousands of Dollars

## Is M365 and the Power Platform the right solution for your business?

- Do you already have an M365 tenant?
- You may have to explain what M365 is to your client.
- You may need to guide or create their tenant for them. 

## General Freelancing Advice 

- Ask early (if not at the very beginning) for their cost / time constraints.
- Whoever mentions a amount of money is at a disadvantage.

- Identify the scale of the project
    - $250/hr ($225/hr for blocks of guaranteed work each week or in blocks of 10 hours or more)
        - $100/hr = $200k/year
    - Small: $500 - $2,000
    - Medium: $2,000 - $10,000
    - Large: $10,000 - $50,000
    - Enterprise: $50,000 - $500,000
- Focus on the benefits of the project, not the features.

- Questions to answer for yourselff
    - Are they jerks? Will they be a pain to work with?
    - Are they going to be reasonable?
    - Are they aware of the fees (Fiver 20% on both sides)
        - Quote for $10k
        - Paying $12k
        - Getting on $8k
        - Fiverr gets $4k
        - Mention: its worth it (for me, it is for the marketing)


- "If I come back with a proposal for $10,000, is that going to be a problem?"
    $3k to $25k is typical for probjects I do
- I don't take on projects less than 4 weeks

3 sides cost/time (triangle)
- Good? 
    Quality (not to compete on price - commoditization)
- Fast? 
    - Dev time - depend on the quality
    - Tools and templates help 
- Cheap? ($50 - $1,000)
    - Slow? I could come down quite a bit. 

    - Not good, not fast
    - Not fast, not good
    - Not cheap, not good
    - Not cheap, not fast

- Ask about deployment

How to extract ALL the requirements from clients/customers
How to break down and unpack the requirements
Identify core elements of the requirements
ðŸ‘‰ Database Tables
ðŸ‘‰ Relationships
ðŸ‘‰ Workflows
ðŸ‘‰ Automations
ðŸ‘‰ Reports
Create a Design that creates a profound effect in the clients / customers / boss
ðŸ‘‰ Database Diagram
ðŸ‘‰ Wireframes / Mockups
ðŸ‘‰ User Stories
Identify an MVP (minimal viable product)
ðŸ‘‰ What is the smallest feature (this could be the the initial data entry screen and that's it)
ðŸ‘‰ Deliver on this small MVP within an afternoon or 1 to 3 days, fostering trust in you from them.
Work up a formal proposal which includes the requirements, the phases (what's coming after the MVP,), the design, the proposed cost and time estimates.
Verify with the client / customer that everything has been included and accounted for
Keep in mind that without exceptions every project includes unforseen or unexpressed requirements and changes.
Calculate time / cost estimates taking all line items in your proposal.
ðŸ‘‰ Figuring out an hourly rate is rarely a problem, but at least have this in mind
ðŸ‘‰ For each line item give your best estimate of how many days it will take to implement.
ðŸ‘‰ Double your time estimate for flat rate projects (you need a margin here that will account for some scope creep and other unforeseen circumstances).
ðŸ‘‰ Add up all the hours for all line items in your proposal draft. If you are creating a cost estimate, multiply that sum by your hourly rate.
When asking for $20,000 or more, be sure to make your proposal document look like a million bucks!
