    take a look at this erd diagram attached. I created with https://drawsql.app/

    Many of the fields don't include the proper types. I want you to infer the types based on the names of the fields

    In the markdown tables you create for me, I need several columns in each (I want you to infer as much from the diagram for the values): 

    Column Name
    SharePoint Field Type
    Length/Precision
    Nullable (Yes/No)
    Primary Key (Yes/No)
    Foreign Key (Yes/No)
    Description
    Default Value
    Constraints

    The target data source is SharePoint Online lists. Use Sharepoint column types
    Do not use lookup or any other complex types. Only use the following simple Sharepoint types 

    FieldType: "Single Line of Text",
    FieldType: "Numeric",
    FieldType: "Yes/No",
    FieldType: "Date Time",
    FieldType: "Multi-Line Text"
```
