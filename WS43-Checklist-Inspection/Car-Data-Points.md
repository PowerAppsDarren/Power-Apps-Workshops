## Technical Specifications

- Engine Type
- Engine Size
- Fuel Type
- Transmission Type
- Drivetrain (e.g., FWD, RWD, AWD)
- Horsepower
- Torque
- Number of Cylinders
- Number of Doors
- Seating Capacity
- Curb Weight
- Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR)

## Dimensions

- Length
- Width
- Height
- Wheelbase
- Ground Clearance
- Cargo Volume

## Performance and Efficiency

- Fuel Economy (City/Highway/Combined)
- Acceleration (0-60 mph time)
- Top Speed
- Towing Capacity
- Payload Capacity

## Safety and Features

- Safety Rating
- Airbag Locations
- Anti-lock Braking System (ABS)
- Traction Control
- Stability Control
- Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)

## Exterior
