## "The Ultimate JumpStart Kit" (v1 - 2021-09-01)

## "Power Apps Tempalates" - Skool Group 

- [Skool Group based on this one](https://www.skool.com/power-apps-templates)
- "JumpStart Kit v2.0"
    - Started with C# in mind (after pollling, most just wanted to master PA first before C#)
    - Started in 3 different directions 
    - Eventually, from scratch, then adding some truly great features 
        - Creating Sharepoint Sites, Lists, and Fields
        - Started to want to separate features out to avoid app bloat. 
    - At this point, went on to v3 

## JumpStart Kit Lite (express or lite version)

    - Very slimmed down version that has been freely available.
